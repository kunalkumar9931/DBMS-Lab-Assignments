## 📌 Project Description

This project focuses on retrieving information from a database using SQL without making any changes to the actual data. It helps in understanding how to view, filter, arrange, and calculate data stored in tables using SQL queries.

The database contains tables such as Student, Faculty, Course, and Enrollment, and all queries are written using read-only SQL commands.

### 🎯 Purpose of the Project 

The main purpose of this project is to:

Learn how to fetch data from database tables

Improve readability of query output using column aliases

Apply conditions to display specific records

Sort and limit query results

Perform calculations on data without updating the table

## 🛠️ Concepts Explained
🔹 Data Retrieval (SELECT)

Used to display data stored in tables.
Example:

SELECT * FROM Student;

This shows all student records.

🔹 Column Alias (AS)

Aliases give temporary names to columns in the output, making results easier to understand.
They do not change the actual column names.

🔹 Filtering Data (WHERE)

Used to display records that satisfy specific conditions such as department, gender, or date.

🔹 Sorting Results (ORDER BY)

Arranges data in ascending or descending order to make results organized and readable.

🔹 Limiting Records (LIMIT)

Restricts the number of rows displayed in the output.

🔹 Derived / Computed Output

Allows calculations like age, updated credits, or extracted values using SQL expressions, without modifying stored data.

🔹 Working with Dates

Date functions are used to calculate age, extract year, or compare dates.

## 📂 Lab Work Breakdown

Part A: Displaying data using meaningful aliases

Part B: Applying conditions using WHERE

Part C: Sorting and limiting output

Part D: Creating computed columns and derived results

## ✅ Conclusion

This project builds a strong foundation in basic SQL data retrieval techniques. It is useful for beginners to understand how databases are queried in real-world applications while keeping data safe and unchanged.
